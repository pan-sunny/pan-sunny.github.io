## Synopsis

We will create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. The following plot will show the major European stock indices: Germany DAX (Ibis), Switzerland SMI, France CAC, and UK FTSE. The data are sampled in business time, i.e., weekends and holidays are omitted.

## Major European Stock Indicies

```{r}
data(EuStockMarkets)
mydata <- as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets) %>%
        gather(index, price) %>%
        mutate(time = rep(time(EuStockMarkets), 4))
plot_ly(mydata, x=~time, y=~price, color = ~index, type = "scatter", mode="maker")
```
